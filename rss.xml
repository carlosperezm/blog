After some time in the darkness, I have finally managed to set up a blog and
write my first "serious" entry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think it makes complete sense to start from the beginning, it means, by
showing what I did to get this blog going. I do this mainly for myself, to make
me organize my thoughts and filter all the resources I have used. But I will be
really happy if it also is clear enough for someone to follow along and start
blogging by themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not the conventional blogging system used by other sites like Wordpress
or blogger and although it is not extremely difficult to use, it does require
some skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, no more words, and let's get started.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://example.com/posts/blogging-with-nikola-and-orgmode/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blog</category><guid>https://example.com/posts/blogging-with-nikola-and-orgmode/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2017 10:13:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Org mode tutorial</title><link>https://example.com/posts/org-mode-tutorial/</link><dc:creator>Carlos Perez</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is a document intended to be a tutorial for org mode. It was created by
following the series org mode basics from the blog &lt;a href="http://pragmaticemacs.com/category/org/"&gt;Pragmatic Emacs&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will probably modify it further to also test some specific features related
to blog posts, as there are some parts of the file that need to be adapted.
&lt;/p&gt;
